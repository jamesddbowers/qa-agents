# Source Priority Index

**Purpose**: This document tracks README evaluations and prioritization decisions for external sources before committing to full extraction.

**How to use**:

1. **Stage 1**: Add READMEs to `sources/possible-sources-to-utilize/[source-name]/`
2. **Evaluate**: Create evaluation using [readme-evaluation-template.md](readme-evaluation-template.md)
3. **Add to this index**: Update priority sections below based on evaluation
4. **Stage 2**: Review collectively and finalize priorities
5. **Stage 3**: Request full repos for High Priority sources

## High Priority Sources

**Criteria**: Addresses critical gaps from [gap-tracker.md](gap-tracker.md), unique patterns, high alignment with Phase 1 MVP

Sources that should be extracted next (highest value):

| Source Name | Type | MVP Steps | Key Patterns | Justification | Eval Date |
|-------------|------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| (No sources evaluated yet) | | | | | |

---

## Medium Priority Sources

**Criteria**: Useful patterns but not urgent, may address future phases or provide supplementary patterns

Sources to extract after high priority complete:

| Source Name | Type | MVP Steps | Key Patterns | Justification | Eval Date |
|-------------|------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| (No sources evaluated yet) | | | | | |

---

## Low Priority / Archive

**Criteria**: Not relevant to current MVP, may revisit in later phases or discard

Sources to archive for later or discard:

| Source Name | Type | MVP Steps | Key Patterns | Justification | Eval Date |
|-------------|------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| (No sources evaluated yet) | | | | | |

## Evaluation History

Complete record of all sources evaluated:

| Source Name | Type | MVP Steps | QA Relevance | Agent Patterns | Priority | Status | Eval Date | Notes |
|-------------|------|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| (No sources evaluated yet) | | | | | | | | |

**Status Values**:

- **Not Started**: README not yet added
- **Evaluating**: Evaluation in progress
- **Evaluated**: Evaluation complete, priority assigned
- **Queued for Extraction**: Approved for Stage 3, waiting for full repo
- **Extracting**: Full extraction in progress
- **Extracted**: Complete, patterns integrated
- **Archived**: Low priority, archived for future consideration

## Next Actions

### Ready to Request in Full

*(Sources with High Priority that need full repos)*

- (None yet)

### Follow-Up Questions

*(Sources with questions that need answering before prioritization)*

- (None yet)

### Gaps Still Unfilled

Cross-reference with [gap-tracker.md](gap-tracker.md):

**High Priority Research Gaps** (from gap-tracker.md):

1. API endpoint discovery patterns (blocks MVP Step 1)
2. Postman collection schema (blocks MVP Step 5)
3. ADO YAML patterns (blocks MVP Step 7)

**Medium Priority Research Gaps**:

4. Auth flow patterns (blocks MVP Step 2)
5. Dynatrace export formats (blocks MVP Step 3)
6. Failure classification (blocks MVP Step 8)

**Lower Priority**:

7. Tagging conventions (MVP Step 4)
8. Test data strategies (MVP Step 6)
