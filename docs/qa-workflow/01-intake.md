# Intake Phase

> **Note:** Intake phase agents are out of scope for the current build. This document captures the QA workflow for reference and future agent development.

## Phase Purpose

The Intake phase is about idea conceptualization — making sure everybody has the right plan before any implementation begins. The intake team (highest-level architecture team) works directly with the business to vet feasibility, ensure the concept makes sense, and confirm it's something worth pursuing.

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Fundamental Collaborations |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Detailed and precise user stories | Product Owners, Business Analysts |
| Acceptance criteria that can be easily tested | Product Owners, Business Analysts |

## QA Actions

| QA Action | Spans Across (Roles) | Description |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Understand Requirements | Intake Team, BA, PO | QA participates in meetings to understand feature requests and business/product priorities |
| Identify Risks | BA, PO | Reviews user stories and acceptance criteria early to find risks or gaps |
| Test Strategy Input | BA, PO | Collaborates with stakeholders to clarify requirements and define the test strategy |

## Role Context

- **Intake Team**: The highest-level architecture team. Works directly with business for feasibility conversations. Vets concepts before they enter the pipeline. Not the same as Business Analysts or Product Owners — this team determines if an idea is even worth pursuing.
- **Business Analysts**: Translate business needs into detailed requirements and user stories.
- **Product Owners**: Own the product backlog, prioritize work, define acceptance criteria.

## Feedback Loop

The Continuous Feedback & Improvement phase (Support) feeds back here when issues require full re-prioritization and re-planning (as opposed to short-circuiting to Implementation for quick fixes).
