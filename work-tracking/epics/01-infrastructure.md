# Epic 01: Infrastructure

## Objective

Set up folder structure, work tracking, CLAUDE.md updates, and session continuity so all subsequent work has a clear home and any new session can pick up where the last left off.

## Relationships

- **Upstream**: None — this is the first epic
- **Downstream**: All epics (02–07) depend on this infrastructure being in place
- **Key Output**: `work-tracking/STATUS.md` is the entry point for every session; `CLAUDE.md` provides project context and context loading rules; `work-tracking/decisions/` captures architectural decisions

## Tasks

- [x] Create folder structure (docs/, work-tracking/, qa-sdlc-agents/)
- [x] Create STATUS.md
- [x] Create epic stub files with Relationships sections
- [x] Update root CLAUDE.md for full SDLC scope
- [x] Finalize session continuity instructions (context loading rules in CLAUDE.md)
- [x] Create ADR-001 for project foundation decisions (BDD/TDD, phasing, tool choices, build order)
- [x] Add cross-references between all epic files and their source documents
